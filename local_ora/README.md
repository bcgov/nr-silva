# Overview

Contains any docs / scripts / libs etc that are used to generate the SILVA "just enough 
oracle" environment, to help support local development without the need for a VPN - on
prem database connection.

# Migrations

Migrations where generated using the data-query tool located [here](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-oracle-env)

The migrations in the folder [migrations/sql](local_ora/migrations/sql) were generated by running the script
[create-migration.sh](local_ora/create_migrations.sh) that references the
data-query tool.

The script was run using the following tables as seed tables:
